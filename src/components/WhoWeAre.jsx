                <p className="max-w-[500px] mt-3">We started Inkpot because we wanted to help out the aspiring writers in our community. Writing is an essential skill to develop in school, but oftentimes what teachers are looking for is vague for kids, especially when transitioning into a new school like from middle school to high school. It can be overwhelming to adjust to that transition, and it isn’t uncommon to see kids who discard writing entirely as just a skill they just aren’t good at. Additionally, teachers can’t help every student all the time, and so some students can’t get the help they’re looking for. These apparent issues are what budded this program. The idea for the program started at the beginning of our junior year at Watchung Hills. We started out small and our goal was to help our freshmen out with English essays and general questions about high school life. We tutored kids in class and after school while also talking to teachers about their progress. We saw our students begin to excel and found positive testimonials from teachers flooding in. The positive success from this year has really motivated us to push the program beyond our school walls, which I believe has brought us to today. Our tutors are some of the most talented writers I know who have such incredible accolades, but most importantly, they are all so deeply passionate about seeing a student succeed. Inkpot is a completely free service and never plans to charge. Accessibility to us as a resource is so huge, and we’re willing to move mountains to fit anyone’s schedule. Face to-face, through Zoom, specific days, or any other requests we’ll strive to accommodate for you. So please contact us so we can help your student’s ideas breakthrough!
